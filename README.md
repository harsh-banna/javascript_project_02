this is my project on asynchronous programming

it contents three parts 

1. callback
   in this a site is made in which by help of callback the result is printed after 5sec and the data is fetched

2. promise
   in this a new promise is made and then used to showcase the fetched data on site and for catching the error .catch is used

3. async/await
   in the the promise is resolved by useing async and await and catch mathod is used to collect the error
